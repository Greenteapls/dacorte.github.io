### This blog a day concept is definitely a great idea.

**It's good to check in with yourself** and to put out your mind in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to reference. The issue comes with doing the same things over and over. I believe that once you're overstimulated, rituals become more difficult to uphold. The feeling of dopamine provided by successfully completing a ritual isn't comparable to playing video games, eating junk food or watching porn, although rituals promote better mental health and long-term well being. This is why it's so hard to keep up, the alternatives are designed to hook us. If we don't escape these external sources, we'll get stuck on our journey and not create the things we want to put out there.
