When I do something that goes with the dulling of my mind, regret sets in. Is it not my chief office the duty to keep my body ready and my mind sharp? Is overeating, lethargy, laziness and other general ways of avoiding work not an obvious enemy to who I want to become? Yes, they are, so, therefore, I should do the following simple commandments:

* Protect energy at all costs:
  * Exercise and stretch
  * Walk daily 
  * Do not overeat
* Be consistent with the behaviours that bring traction 
  * Learn and read
  * Execute on personal projects
* Create bonds that will help you become this person you want to become
  * Socialize when possible 
  * Seek out creators and create yourself 
  * Have something that can be a window into who you are

I've been feeling the brevity of time a bit more accutely lately. I guess I can blame that on those Seneca audiobooks. Still absolutely mesmerized that someone who was alive 2000 years ago understands the human experience so deeply, before our attention has become commoditized. Perhaps, it always was.
