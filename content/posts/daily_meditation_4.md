Writing a daily thought before bed. That was quite the long day. Energy comes from maintaining a routine and tending to our bodies, something that was certainly not respected today. I need to enforce stricter boundaries.

The quote that stuck with me from yesterday was "Your mind is mde for having ideas, not holding them". Studying programming and other technical things has me in this neurotic state to maintain things in my head. My head functions much better when I don't have anything bothering me. 

I was thinking of the things that could ruin my vacation and, somehow, the first thing that popped to mind was a neurotic need to control the outcome. If I go with a group, I should enjoy the company, rather than try to dictate what my experience is going to be.

Letting go reduces the neurotic impulse. Minimizing these neurotic impulses allows one to be more present and actually enjoy what's happening. 

That's it, time to sleep.
