## Embodiment

Imagine you want to be someone who is an expert at something, says, writing or video. What if you acted as if you're that person. You'd fail at first, but you'd quickly move towards the person you want to be. If you didn't do this, due to perfectionism or any other reason, your progress would suffer. It would be suboptimal at this point not to embody who you want to be, because to act as that person you'd need to constantly hone yourself in that direction, which is something your current self doesn't have to do. 

Oh, accountability, what a powerful thing. There's a reason it's programmed into us, or at least the properly functioning ones.
