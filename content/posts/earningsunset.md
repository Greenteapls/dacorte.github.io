The merchants among us are well versed in the art of comercialising their time. Whatever activity it is, if there's a byproduct, there's a market for it.

Then, marketing it comes in play, this shouldn't be the case before the production is streamlined. This is usually done with the passion of a hobbyist. 

I too need to follow this archetype and build a basis for value creation, and its tied fortune, that is not bound to the whims of an external party. 

Streamline > produce > market > grow.

Frameworks are at the helm. Get started, be consistent, plan ahead, have non-negotiables.
