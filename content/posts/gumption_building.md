### New Machine

I've got a new computer and a whole new setup. 

I have to admit, at first I thought that building a computer was a dumb idea due to the added stress and risk. I did think that way all the way through my initial problems, such as misconnected motherboard cables, but once he was fully set up, I fell in love with this thing I built. The fact that it functions far beyond what I expected is only the cherry on top. Amazing value, this combination of 5600 + 6650 XT. It's also cool, only occasionally requiring the fans once the components go above 45 degrees. It's super energy efficient too. Great stuff.

### Who Says Gumption Anyway

I'm almost finish ZAMM and it really picks up by the end. It introduces the concept of gumption, which in my head translates more towards mental energy, or focus, and is the raw material in the information age. Certainly a mechanic's fuel. I'll try to adapt its teachings more towards my life and write more about it. 

I've also watched a video about a marketer explaining the 3 lines of marketing, these being cost, price and perceived value. It's really obvious when you look at it, but I really love simple and fundamental approaches. First principles, always. 

Anyhow, it's 3:30 am and I'm trying to remember how to set up everything in a new machine. Maybe I should just push the blog to github and make that folder private. I'll take a shower, read a couple of pages and go to bed.
