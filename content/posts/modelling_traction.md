## Frameworks and Models

While searching for tools to help me be consistent, even when my body is sapped, I've come across a model that can be used to describe the elements of traction.

> Energy + Clarity + Willpower * Focus = Traction/Output

Let's expand on these elements by breaking them down.

| Elements | Gained by | Spent By | 
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Energy | True Rest (Meditation/Napping/Deep Sleep)| Everything Else / Task Switching|
| Clarity | Writing down your objectives - The more precise and granular, the clearer / Maintaining Good Posture | Not being diligent, not being constant |
| Willpower | Visualization / Avoiding Excess (Food, Stimuli) / Meditation / Exercise | Using Devices / Sugars / Alcohol / Mistreating your body and mind |

So, from this table it becomes clear that each element of this equation is negatively or positively affected by actions that we take in our everyday life.

Constantly switching tasks in a near compulsive manner, overeating, being sleep deprived, eating a ton of sugar, not wanting to have change in one's life, not consistently practicing one's skills, these things lead to a life of mediocrity and self loathing. One can't help but sigh at the lost potential, for we all know that there is a sea of potential in each and every one of us, waiting to be tapped, if only the circumstances would allow.

## The Pantheon

One thing that is common across most people we develop an admiration for is that they are consistent in their striving for greatness. Even if bestowed with excessive talent, they still stuck to their way and followed through diligently by constantly engaging in traction. 

One of my future blogs/series will be in my personal pantheon. In the absence of religion, the decline in spirituality has led many people to anchor their beliefs to other humans. I'm no different in this matter. I've selected a few characters whose Way I consider worthy of study and following. When advice is needed, I seek comfort in their teachings. An example of these characters is Musashi, Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, to name a few. Their works and personal achievements led me to place them as the pinacle of what to strive for.
