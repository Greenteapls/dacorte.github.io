  <section><p>Escaping distraction is something that is so deeply important in order to get anything of true importance done, yet gets no highlight during this mighty age of distraction we live in. The big business of etnertainment has grown gigantic and must pay its figureheads, that are accustomed to exceedingly large paychecks.</p>
<p>Entertainment at scale, they say, is their way to bring value. And some of that value is, indeed, valuable. There are a ton of talented personalites out there that warrant your attention, but there&rsquo;s a limit to everything. Our brains enjoy this distraction and, after a while, it becomes more of a habit rather than a thing we do in our downtime. It starts slipping into our busy schedules and it&rsquo;s there for us when our attention is needed the most. When we realise, it&rsquo;s gone. Our attention is gone. We try to rest to recuperate it, but our withdrawal symptoms direct us back to those charismatic personalities. What are we to do in this high-age of distraction?</p>
<h3 id="rest">Rest</h3>
<p>Make time for boredom and true rest. Escape all distractions, give them no opportunity to cage us. It is my dream to build a focus retreat, where people come with nothing but the essentials, havve no internet, the option to cook, or not, and then have time for connecting with others, discussing ideas, communing with nature and killing that never-ceasing inner struggle that comes with an over-stimulated brain. I can see it. It&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>Japan is a mecca for those seeking effective simplicity. Minimalism.</p>
