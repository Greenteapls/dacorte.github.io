      <description>Embodiment Imagine you want to be someone who is an expert at something, says, writing or video. What if you acted as if you&amp;rsquo;re that person. You&amp;rsquo;d fail at first, but you&amp;rsquo;d quickly move towards the person you want to be. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t do this, due to perfectionism or any other reason, your progress would suffer. It would be suboptimal at this point not to embody who you want to be, because to act as that person you&amp;rsquo;d need to constantly hone yourself in that direction, which is something your current self doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do.</description>

      <description>Fall Down And here we go again, we&amp;rsquo;re closing in on March. For most people, this equates to milder weather and growing vegetation, but as the month of my birth, it has a special meaning to me. I&amp;rsquo;m turning 29 soon, and am yet to achieve anything of true significance in my life. I notice that the amount of time spent on distractions is on the thousands of hours. In fact, anything that can mildly represent my goals and aspirations has taken a back seat for the better part of the last few years.</description>

      <title>Daily Meditation #4</title>

      <description>Daily Meditation #4 Writing a daily thought before bed. That was quite the long day. Energy comes from maintaining a routine and tending to our bodies, something that was certainly not respected today. I need to enforce stricter boundaries.
The quote that stuck with me from yesterday was &amp;ldquo;Your mind is mde for having ideas, not holding them&amp;rdquo;. Studying programming and other technical things has me in this neurotic state to maintain things in my head.</description>

      <description>New Machine I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new computer and a whole new setup.
I have to admit, at first I thought that building a computer was a dumb idea due to the added stress and risk. I did think that way all the way through my initial problems, such as misconnected motherboard cables, but once he was fully set up, I fell in love with this thing I built. The fact that it functions far beyond what I expected is only the cherry on top.</description>

      <description>Not being as consistent as I should with my reading and writing. It is hard to stay productive when there are so many distractions, which are satisfying but end up undermining true progress.
It&amp;rsquo;s good to push something, even if small.</description>

      <description>I take notes using Jupyter Notebooks, so this blog format is ideal.
Creating a Table Notation CREATE TABLE &amp;#34;Table name&amp;#34; ( Id char(10) PRIMARY KEY, Brand char(10) NOT NULL, Type char(250) NOT NULL, Price decimal(8,2) NOT NULL, Desc Varchar(750) NULL ); Null values accept everything. Null doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean empty string (Spaces, for example)
Inserting data into table You list all the columns that you&amp;rsquo;ll be filling and with what.
INSERT INTO &amp;#34;Table name&amp;#34; (Id ,Brand ,Type ,Price , Desc ) VALUES (&amp;#39;123456&amp;#39; ,&amp;#39;Gucci&amp;#39; ,&amp;#39;Slippers&amp;#39; ,&amp;#39;695.</description>
