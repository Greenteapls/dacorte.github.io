  <section><h2 id="asleep">Asleep</h2>
<p>People are outside, living their lives, inching towards their goals. Slowly, but surely, they&rsquo;re getting there. Language courses complete, businesses launched, projects finished. They keep putting in the work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing what I usually do. I keep learning things, I keep postponing projects, saying that I&rsquo;m getting ready for the real opportunity, while using that as an excuse not to push, not to create actions that get me closer to my goals.
And time passes. On and on. Over 10 years have gone by since I first had the idea to go my own way. The force in me, the creative entity, keeps pushing. It wants to come out.</p>
<p>##Waking up</p>
<p>So I have to do this. I have to create. I can&rsquo;t let the comfort win. I can&rsquo;t stay my whole life without creating and having an impact in people&rsquo;s lives. There&rsquo;s so much I can give, I know it. I just need to push. I need to act. And every action has to count. Less movements that are more meaningful, that is the way.</p>
